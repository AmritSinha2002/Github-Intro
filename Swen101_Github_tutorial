A paragraph about yourself (what High School you attended and so forth), what are your hobbies etc...
Hello, I am Amrit Sinha, I attended Andover High School in, Andover, MA. I have a few different hobbies. Back in my highschool days I used to play a lot of video games,
since coming to RIT i've been laying off of those and have been more into sports. I feel like during quarantine I just played too many video games and it kind of just got bland.
Another one of my hobbies is procrastinating, that's probably what I spend most of my time doing honestly...
